# World-Of-Walker-Elo

An implementation to rank your favourite songs from Alan Walker's 2021 album World of Walker. Uses the Elo rating system, which is also used in calculation of chess ratings. Entries with a higher rating are deemed better than entries with a lower rating.


This implementation practically works with any kind of entries, but I decided to use the songs from World of Walker.
